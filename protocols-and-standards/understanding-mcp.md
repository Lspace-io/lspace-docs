# Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to standardize how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It acts as a universal interface, similar to how USB-C provides a standard connection for various hardware devices.

As defined by its official documentation at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), MCP facilitates the integration of LLMs with diverse data sources and tools.

## Key Concepts of MCP

- **Standardization**: MCP provides a consistent way for AI models to connect with different data sources and tools, enhancing interoperability.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: MCP typically involves:
    - **MCP Hosts**: Applications (like IDEs or AI tools) that want to access data/tools via MCP.
    - **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients within hosts that connect to MCP Servers.
    - **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs (like Lspace's `lspace-mcp-server.js`) that expose specific capabilities (e.g., access to local files, databases, or remote services) through the MCP standard.
- **Benefits**: 
    - Enables a growing ecosystem of pre-built integrations.
    - Offers flexibility in switching between LLM providers.
    - Promotes best practices for data security within an organization's infrastructure.

## Lspace and MCP

The Lspace project includes an **MCP Server** (`lspace-mcp-server.js`). This component allows Lspace to expose its functionalities (like repository management, knowledge base generation, and interaction with Git services) in a standardized way that MCP-compatible hosts and clients can consume.

When Lspace documentation refers to its "MCP Server," it means its implementation that adheres to the Model Context Protocol. This allows AI agents and other development tools to interact with Lspace's features programmatically.
