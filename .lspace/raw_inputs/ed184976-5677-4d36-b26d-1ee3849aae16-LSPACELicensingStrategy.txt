🛠️ LSPACE Licensing Strategy Summary

🔓 License: Business Source License (BSL)
	•	Default license for the LSPACE repository
	•	Allows free use, modification, and self-hosting for:
	•	Personal projects
	•	Research
	•	Internal non-commercial use
	•	Commercial use is restricted unless:
	•	You purchase a commercial license
	•	Or you use the official LSPACE Cloud hosted service

⸻

🧭 Conversion Clause
	•	After 1 or 2 years, each version of the codebase automatically converts to a fully open-source license (e.g. Apache 2.0 or MIT)
	•	This provides:
	•	Long-term transparency and trust
	•	A clear path for community forks and archival usage
	•	Ongoing incentive to use the cloud service for the latest version

⸻

💸 Monetization Path
	•	Offer a hosted, managed version of LSPACE for users and teams who:
	•	Don’t want to self-host
	•	Need scalability, uptime guarantees, support, or enhanced features
	•	Keep premium features (e.g., dashboards, usage analytics, multi-tenant infra) exclusive to the cloud version

⸻

🧠 Why this works
	•	✅ Protects early-stage IP from commercial exploitation by larger players
	•	✅ Encourages adoption and contributions without giving away the commercial upside
	•	✅ Aligns with successful companies like Sentry, MariaDB, and CockroachDB
	•	✅ Future-proofs openness with automatic open-source relicense after a set term
