# Context-Switching Friction in AI Workflows

## The Challenge
Lspace eliminates context-switching friction by allowing users to capture insights from any AI session and instantly make them available across all tools, transforming scattered conversations into persistent, searchable knowledge.

### The Modern AI User's Dilemma
Todayâ€™s AI-powered professionals frequently switch between multiple tools, such as:
- ChatGPT for general queries and brainstorming
- Claude Desktop for document analysis and writing
- Claude Code for development tasks
- Cursor for coding with AI assistance
- Various other AI tools and platforms

Each tool's specialization traps valuable insights and context in individual sessions, causing users to:
- Continuously copy-paste information between tools
- Re-explain the same context multiple times
- Lose valuable insights as sessions conclude
- Struggle to sustain a consistent knowledge base across platforms
- Manually manage scattered conversations and discoveries
