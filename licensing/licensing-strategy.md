# LSPACE Licensing Strategy

LSpace employs a Business Source License (BSL) model as the default for its repository. This licensing strategy enables:

- **Free usage, modification, and self-hosting** for personal projects, research, and internal non-commercial use.
- **Commercial use** requires either a purchase of a commercial license or using the official LSPACE Cloud hosted service.

### Conversion Clause

- After 1 or 2 years, each version of the codebase automatically converts to a fully open-source license like Apache 2.0 or MIT.
- This transition fosters transparency, trust, and facilitates community-driven forks and archival usage.

### Monetization Path

- Offering a hosted, managed version of LSPACE attracts users who prefer not to self-host or require additional scalability, uptime, support, or advanced features.
- Maintains exclusive premium features for the cloud version.

### Strategic Benefits

- Protects early-stage intellectual property from large-scale commercial exploitation.
- Encourages adoption and community contributions while securing commercial viability.
- Aligns with strategies of successful companies such as Sentry, MariaDB, and CockroachDB.
- Ensures future openness through automatic transition to open-source licenses.
