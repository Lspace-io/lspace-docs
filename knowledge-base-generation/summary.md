# Knowledge Base Summary

## Overview
The Lspace knowledge base is structured around a central hub (the repository root) where synthesized information from raw inputs is organized into a coherent documentation set. Each section or topic has dedicated files or directories, and the `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview of the entire knowledge base, offering links and guidance for further reading.

## Sections
- **Getting Started Guide**: Help users begin with Lspace Server, involving setup and initial configuration guidance.
